        I'm a tech communicator with a passion for connecting people and ideas. With a background in learning and
	development, community building, as well as partnership building, I've helped organizations craft effective communication 
	strategies and foster meaningful connections. I thrive in fast-paced startup environments, where I've learned to 
	prioritize what matters most and get things done with my team.

      <h1>My work</h1>
      <p>
        I'm currently Ecosystem Coordinator at <a href="https://www.zendis.de/">ZenDiS</a> (the German Centre for 
	Digital Sovereignty), where I focus on strengthening the digital sovereignty of the public sector through 
	secure and adaptable open-source software solutions.

        With my academic background in the history of technology, I bring a deep understanding of its 
	social context. This knowledge informs my commitment to making technology accessible to all 
	through clear communication and inclusive practices ðŸ”“
