      <h1>Hello there! 👋</h1>

	  <p>
	  </p>
    
      <p>
       	Over the past years, I’ve developed and delivered digital skills trainings, led consulting projects for 
		public and private sector clients, and helped coordinate multi-country collaborations around sovereign IT solutions. 
		I’ve also advised on partner and community management strategies, built structured partner journeys from the ground up, 
		and supported open source adoption through public speaking and stakeholder engagement.

      <p>
        I'm currently Partnership Lead at <a href="https://www.zendis.de/">ZenDiS</a> (the German Centre for 
	Digital Sovereignty), where I focus on strengthening the digital sovereignty of the public sector through 
	secure and adaptable open source software solutions.
	  </p>
      <p>
    With a background in the history of technology, I approach digital transformation with a critical understanding of how 
		  technologies evolve, who they serve, and what values they reflect. This perspective helps me communicate technical 
		  topics in a way that is context-aware and inclusive.
      </p>
      <p>
Outside of work, I spend my time kayaking and visiting art museums — both ways to slow down, observe more closely, and see familiar things from a new angle 🛶🖼️
