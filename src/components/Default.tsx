        I am a tech communicator with experience in professional learning and development, 
	community building, and fostering partner relationships. I have a proven track record 
	in developing effective B2B communication strategies, leading web-based crowdsourcing 
	projects, organizing events, and fostering mutually beneficial partnerships between organizations. 
	Working in fast-paced startup environments has taught me to streamline processes and achieve 
	tangible outcomes alongside my team.
